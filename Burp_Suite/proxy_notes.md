Generally speaking, proxy servers by definition allow us to relay our traffic through an ***alternative route to the internet***. This can be done for a variety of reasons ranging from educational filtering (common in schools where restricted content must be blocked) to accessing content that may be otherwise unavailable due to region locking or a ban. Using a proxy, however, for web application testing allows us to view and modify traffic inline at a granular level. Throughout this task, we'll explore the major components of the Burp proxy including interception, request history, and the various configuration options we have access to.
