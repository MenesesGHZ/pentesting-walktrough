Burp Suite Professional is one of the most popular penetration testing and vulnerability finder tools, and is often used for checking web application security. “Burp,” as it is commonly known, is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on testing.

- Proxy: What allows us to funnel traffic through Burp Suite for further analysis
- Target: How we set the scope of our project. We can also use this to effectively create a site map of the application we are testing.
- Intruder: Incredibly powerful tool for everything from field fuzzing to credential stuffing and more
- Repeater: Allows us to 'repeat' requests that have previously been made with or without modification. Often used in a precursor step to fuzzing with the aforementioned Intruder
- Sequencer: Analyzes the 'randomness' present in parts of the web app which are intended to be unpredictable. This is commonly used for testing session cookies
- Decoder: As the name suggests, Decoder is a tool that allows us to perform various transforms on pieces of data. These transforms vary from decoding/encoding to various bases or URL encoding.
- Comparer: Comparer as you might have guessed is a tool we can use to compare different responses or other pieces of data such as site maps or proxy histories (awesome for access control issue testing). This is very similar to the Linux tool diff.
- Extender: Similar to adding mods to a game like Minecraft, Extender allows us to add components such as tool integrations, additional scan definitions, and more!
- Scanner: Automated web vulnerability scanner that can highlight areas of the application for further manual investigation or possible exploitation with another section of Burp. This feature, while not in the community edition of Burp Suite, is still a key facet of performing a web application test.

### Target Definition

The Target tab in Burp allows us to perform arguably some of the most important parts of a web application penetration test:
- Defining our scope.

- Viewing a site map.

- Specifying our issue definitions (although this is more useful within report generation and scanning).

### Repeater
 
Repeater allows us to ***repeat requests we've already made***. These ***requests can either be reissued as-is or with modifications***. In contrast to Intruder, Repeater is typically used for the purposes of experimentation or more fine-tuned exploitation wherein automation may not be desired.
